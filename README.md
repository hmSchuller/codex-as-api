Use ChatGPT / Codex OAuth as a local OpenAI-compatible API server.

## Features

- **OpenAI & Anthropic compatible** — `POST /v1/chat/completions` and `POST /v1/messages` endpoints
- **Claude Code ready** — use Codex models directly from Claude Code CLI
- **Streaming** — full SSE streaming for both OpenAI and Anthropic protocols
- **Tool calling** — function calls, tool results, and parallel tool calls
- **Image support** — generation, inspection, multimodal Chat input, and capability-gated `original` image detail in classic Responses
- **Reasoning** — configurable effort/context, `standard` mode compatibility, persisted reasoning, and streaming thinking content
- **Codex features** — session-aware `prompt_cache_key`, process-local Chat `response_id` continuation, subagent headers, and remote compaction
- **Codex config aware** — reads `CODEX_HOME` / `~/.codex/config.toml` for reasoning-effort and context-window settings
- **Token estimate & compaction helpers** — Anthropic-compatible `/v1/messages/count_tokens` and `/v1/messages/compact`
- **Auto auth** — reads `~/.codex/auth.json` and auto-refreshes OAuth tokens
- **3 implementations** — Python, TypeScript (npm), and Rust share the Codex transport foundations; the TypeScript and Python servers include the Cursor Luna bridge

## What it does

Runs a lightweight HTTP server on `localhost` that translates standard OpenAI API calls into authenticated requests against the ChatGPT / Codex backend using your existing `~/.codex/auth.json` OAuth credentials.

Python, Rust, and TypeScript (npm) implementations are provided. Use the TypeScript or Python server for the Cursor + Luna bridge described below; Rust retains the lower-level compatibility implementation.

## Personal Cursor + Luna Quick Start

The supported personal workflow uses one Codex account, one local TypeScript proxy, and one remotely managed Cloudflare Tunnel:

1. Run `codex login`
2. Change into the TypeScript package: `cd ts`
3. Install dependencies: `npm ci`
4. Run `npm run setup`
5. Configure the named Cloudflare Tunnel hostname to point to `http://127.0.0.1:8787`
6. Run `npm start`
7. Paste the printed Base URL and proxy API key into Cursor
8. Select `gpt-5.6-luna-high`, `gpt-5.6-luna-xhigh`, or `gpt-5.6-luna-max`

After setup, `npm start` launches both the local proxy and named tunnel. The normal startup checks Codex authentication, the local health endpoint, the tunnel connection, and the authenticated Luna model catalog before printing Cursor settings.

## Prerequisites

The TypeScript workflow requires Node.js 18 or newer. Python development and
CI checks use Python 3.12 by default through `PYTHON_VERSION`; the package
metadata continues to support Python 3.10 and newer.

Install the official Codex CLI and log in so that `~/.codex/auth.json` exists:

```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex
codex login
```

The server reads that file to obtain and refresh ChatGPT OAuth tokens automatically.

`tokens` and latest root-level `access_token` / `refresh_token` / `id_token` auth files are supported. `personal_access_token`-only, `agent_identity`-only, and `bedrock_api_key`-only auth files are not supported for the ChatGPT OAuth backend; rerun `codex login` if you hit that diagnostic.

## Cursor + GPT-5.6 Luna via ChatGPT subscription

This proxy keeps Cursor as the agent. Cursor supplies the system prompt, developer instructions, repository context, conversation history, tools, and tool execution loop; the proxy only authenticates and translates the inference request to the ChatGPT/Codex Responses backend.

### Prerequisites

1. Install the official Codex CLI and authenticate the ChatGPT account:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @openai/codex
   codex login
   ```

2. Confirm that `~/.codex/auth.json` contains file-backed OAuth tokens. The proxy never uses the Cursor API key as an upstream credential.

### Run the proxy

The TypeScript server is the Cursor-focused implementation. For the personal workflow, configure it once and use the named Cloudflare Tunnel automatically:

```bash
cd ts
npm ci
npm run setup
npm start
```

`npm run setup` creates a local, ignored `.env`, generates `PROXY_API_KEY` with 32 cryptographically secure random bytes, asks for `CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN` and `PUBLIC_URL`, and checks Node, `cloudflared`, and Codex authentication. It does not overwrite existing non-empty values. `npm run config` prints the local Cursor configuration with the real proxy key when it is needed.

`HOST` and `PORT` are aliases for the existing `CODEX_AS_API_HOST` and `CODEX_AS_API_PORT` settings. `PROXY_API_KEY` is sent by Cursor as `Authorization: Bearer <PROXY_API_KEY>` on `/v1` requests. It is not an OpenAI or ChatGPT credential. The tunnel token is never sent to Cursor or placed in the cloudflared command arguments.

The normal command requires a named/remotely managed Cloudflare Tunnel. Do not use Quick Tunnels. The tunnel must forward the configured hostname to `http://127.0.0.1:8787`; `/health` is intentionally unauthenticated so startup can verify the route, while `/v1` still requires `PROXY_API_KEY`.

### Configure Cursor

Set Cursor's OpenAI-compatible provider to:

```text
Base URL: https://<proxy-host>/v1
API key: <PROXY_API_KEY>
```

For local-only debugging, use `npm run local`. It starts the proxy without cloudflared and uses `http://127.0.0.1:8787/v1`.

### Named Cloudflare Tunnel

Install `cloudflared` separately; setup does not install privileged system packages. On macOS:

```bash
brew install cloudflared
```

Create or use one remotely managed named tunnel in Cloudflare. Configure its public hostname ingress to the local service:

```text
Hostname: luna.example.com
Service:  http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

Copy that tunnel's token into `npm run setup` when prompted. The application starts it with the equivalent of:

```bash
TUNNEL_TOKEN=<token-from-environment> cloudflared tunnel --no-autoupdate run
```

The actual token is passed through the child process environment and never appears in the command arguments. Long-lived SSE responses use the named tunnel route; no Quick Tunnel or alternate provider is involved.

Use `GET /v1/models` to see the model IDs currently exposed by the authenticated Codex account. Add the Luna IDs returned there as Cursor custom models. A typical Luna catalog is:

```text
gpt-5.6-luna
gpt-5.6-luna-medium
gpt-5.6-luna-high
gpt-5.6-luna-xhigh
gpt-5.6-luna-max
luna-medium
luna-high
luna-xhigh
luna-max
```

The list is dynamic. The proxy creates a reasoning alias only when the upstream catalog advertises that exact effort for `gpt-5.6-luna`; it does not claim unsupported levels. Cursor may normalize the longer `gpt-5.6-luna-xhigh` ID back to `gpt-5.6-luna`, so use the short virtual IDs such as `luna-xhigh` and `luna-max` when configuring Cursor. They send `model: gpt-5.6-luna` with the matching `reasoning.effort` upstream. The unsuffixed Luna model uses the catalog's advertised default effort, not a Sol-derived or globally forced value.

### Troubleshooting and verification

- `401` from the proxy means the Cursor API key is missing or incorrect. OAuth errors after that point refer to `~/.codex/auth.json` or its refresh token.
- If startup says Codex authentication is missing, run `codex login` and then `npm start`.
- If startup says `cloudflared` is missing, install it and rerun `npm start`; setup prints the platform-specific installation instruction.
- If the tunnel exits unexpectedly, check that the named tunnel token is current and that its hostname ingress points to `http://127.0.0.1:8787`.
- If the public health check fails, verify that `PUBLIC_URL` is the Cloudflare hostname without `/v1`; Cursor receives the normalized `/v1` URL.
- If Luna is absent from `GET /v1/models`, the authenticated account did not expose Luna in the Codex catalog. The proxy fails Luna requests clearly instead of silently switching to Sol.
- Set `CODEX_AS_API_LOG=info` to log the incoming model, resolved upstream model, reasoning effort, upstream status, response ID, and tool names. Set it to `debug` to inspect model-related request fields and headers. Set it to `trace` to print full incoming request bodies, normalized upstream payloads, raw upstream SSE chunks/events, and outgoing SSE/JSON responses; authorization-style headers are redacted, but prompts, tool schemas, arguments, and tool results are included. Use trace only for local debugging.
- Verify the request path with a model alias such as `gpt-5.6-luna-high` and check the diagnostic line for `resolved model: gpt-5.6-luna reasoning: high`.
- Function tools are forwarded to Luna and returned to Cursor as Chat Completions tool calls. Cursor executes them; this proxy never executes tools.

The proxy supports Chat Completions streaming and local full-history continuation for repeated tool turns. The private Codex Responses Lite route requires `all_turns` reasoning context and does not support hosted tools that need a standalone executor; Cursor-owned function tools remain supported.

## Install & Run

### Python

Install from PyPI:

```bash
pip install codex-as-api
codex-as-api
```

Or with `uv`:

```bash
uv pip install codex-as-api
codex-as-api
```

Or from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Eunho-J/codex-as-api.git
cd codex-as-api
pip install -e ".[server]"
codex-as-api
```

cd rust
cargo build --release
./target/release/codex-as-api
```

### TypeScript (npm)

```bash
npm install -g codex-as-api
codex-as-api
```

Or use `npx` without installing:

```bash
npx codex-as-api
```

Or from source:

```bash
cd ts
npm install
npm run build
node dist/cli.js
```

Can also be used as a library:

```typescript
import { ChatGPTOAuthProvider, createApp } from "codex-as-api";

// Use the provider directly
const provider = new ChatGPTOAuthProvider({ model: "gpt-5.5" });
const response = await provider.chat(
  [
    { role: "system", content: "You are helpful." },
    { role: "user", content: "Hello!" },
  ],
);
console.log(response.content);

// Or create an Express app
const app = createApp();
app.listen(18080);
```

All versions bind to `127.0.0.1:18080` (localhost only) by default.

## Configuration

Environment variables (Python, Rust, and TypeScript):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `HOST` / `CODEX_AS_API_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address |
| `PORT` / `CODEX_AS_API_PORT` | `8787` | Listen port |
| `PROXY_API_KEY` | required by Python and TypeScript executables | Bearer secret required by `/v1` |
| `CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN` | required by `npm start` | Token for the one named Cloudflare Tunnel; passed to cloudflared as `TUNNEL_TOKEN` |
| `PUBLIC_URL` | required by `npm start` | External Cloudflare hostname, such as `https://luna.example.com` |
| `CODEX_AS_API_MODEL` | `gpt-5.6-luna` in Python/TypeScript; Rust keeps its existing Codex-config fallback | Explicit proxy model override |
| `CODEX_AS_API_AUTH_PATH` | `~/.codex/auth.json` | Path to OAuth credentials file |
| `CODEX_AS_API_CODEX_CLI_VERSION` | `0.147.0` | Override the validated Codex compatibility baseline identified in backend request `User-Agent` headers |
| `CODEX_AS_API_RESPONSES_LITE` | `auto` | Responses Lite mode: `auto`, `on`, or `off` |
| `CODEX_AS_API_CODEX_METADATA` | `off` | Add Codex-style per-turn `client_metadata` and related backend headers |
| `CODEX_AS_API_MODEL_CATALOG_TTL_MS` | `300000` | Cache duration for the authenticated Codex model catalog |
| `CODEX_AS_API_LOG` | `info` | Set to `off` to disable diagnostic logs |
| `CODEX_HOME` | `~/.codex` | Codex home directory used for `auth.json` and `config.toml` discovery |

The TypeScript personal workflow reads `ts/.env`. It is local-only and ignored by Git. A minimal file is:

```env
PORT=8787
PROXY_API_KEY=<generated by npm run setup>
CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN=<named tunnel token>
PUBLIC_URL=https://luna.example.com
```

The server also reads root-level Codex CLI reasoning and context settings from `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
model_reasoning_effort = "high"

# Optional overrides. Without them, known models use the bundled Codex catalog values.
model_context_window = 272000
model_auto_compact_token_limit = 244800
```

`CODEX_AS_API_MODEL` or a request-level model overrides the default Luna model. A request-level `reasoning_effort` overrides `model_reasoning_effort`; when both are omitted, known models use the Codex catalog default. The effective model, reasoning setting, and context settings are exposed from `/health`; context settings are also returned by Anthropic token-count responses.

### Supported Models

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `gpt-5.6` | Public alias; resolved to `gpt-5.6-sol` before the Codex OAuth request |
| `gpt-5.6-sol` | Latest frontier agentic coding model; defaults to `low` effort in Codex |
| `gpt-5.6-terra` | Balanced agentic coding model for everyday work; defaults to `medium` effort |
| `gpt-5.6-luna` | Primary Cursor target; default effort comes from the authenticated Codex catalog |
| `gpt-5.5` | Frontier model for complex coding, research, and real-world work |
| `gpt-5.4` | Strong model for everyday coding |
| `gpt-5.4-mini` | Small, fast, and cost-efficient model for simpler coding tasks |
| `gpt-5.3-codex` | Coding-optimized model |
| `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` | Ultra-fast coding model |
| `gpt-5.2` | Previous generation model |

Transport capability behavior is driven by `config/model-capabilities.json`. For Luna visibility, reasoning levels, defaults, context metadata, and account access, the TypeScript Cursor bridge uses the authenticated Codex `/models` catalog at runtime. The public `gpt-5.6` alias retains its existing Sol compatibility behavior. The GPT-5.6 entries use the official Codex Responses Lite contract and a 272,000-token **Codex OAuth** context-window maximum; do not substitute the larger public API context figures for this backend. Larger config overrides are clamped to 272,000. Unknown models use conservative behavior: classic Responses payloads, no assumed parallel tool support, no automatic verbosity, reasoning-effort, or service-tier fields, and, without config overrides, the legacy 200,000-token context / 160,000-token compact thresholds.

To use a different port:

```bash
CODEX_AS_API_PORT=9000 codex-as-api
```

To expose on all interfaces (e.g. for remote access):

```bash
CODEX_AS_API_HOST=0.0.0.0 codex-as-api
```

## API Endpoints

### `POST /v1/chat/completions`

Standard OpenAI chat completions. Supports streaming (`stream: true`) and non-streaming.

```bash
curl http://localhost:18080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-5.5",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}
    ]
  }'
```

Streaming:

```bash
curl http://localhost:18080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-5.5",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}
    ],
    "stream": true
  }'
```

With tools:

```bash
curl http://localhost:18080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-5.5",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "You have access to tools."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "What is the weather in Seoul?"}
    ],
    "tools": [
      {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
          "name": "get_weather",
          "description": "Get current weather",
          "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {"city": {"type": "string"}},
            "required": ["city"]
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }'
```

### `POST /v1/messages`

Anthropic Messages API compatible endpoint. Supports streaming (`stream: true`) and non-streaming. A client model that matches the bundled Codex catalog, such as `gpt-5.6-sol`, is used for the backend call. Anthropic names and other unknown model IDs use the configured `CODEX_AS_API_MODEL` fallback. The response always preserves the client-supplied model name.

```bash
curl http://localhost:18080/v1/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: unused" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
    "max_tokens": 200,
    "system": "You are a helpful assistant.",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}
    ]
  }'
```

Streaming:

```bash
curl -N http://localhost:18080/v1/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: unused" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
    "max_tokens": 200,
    "stream": true,
    "system": "You are a helpful assistant.",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}
    ]
  }'
```

### Identifier and cache behavior

The two compatibility facades intentionally use the similarly named fields for
different jobs:

| Input or output | `/v1/chat/completions` | `/v1/messages` |
|---|---|---|
| `client_metadata.session_id` | Forwarded to Codex, used as the default `prompt_cache_key`, and required when Codex metadata mode is enabled | Not used or forwarded |
| `client_metadata.thread_id` | Codex metadata thread identity; defaults to `session_id` for a root request and preserves an explicit child thread | Not used or synthesized |
| `prompt_cache_key` | Explicit value wins; otherwise a non-empty `client_metadata.session_id` is used; otherwise omitted | Optional proxy extension; explicit value wins, otherwise the Claude Code session header is hashed |
| `x-claude-code-session-id` | Not used | SHA-256 of `codex-as-api:claude-code-session:<exact header value>` supplies cache affinity only |
| `previous_response_id` | Resolves a known entry from the 256-chain process-local history and replays full input/output over HTTP; never forwarded | Non-null values return Anthropic-style HTTP 400 because normal Messages is stateless |
| `cache_control` | Not an OpenAI Chat control | Validated as an Anthropic compatibility hint, then stripped before Codex transport |

Anthropic `cache_control` is a cache-boundary annotation, not an identifier.
This proxy accepts only `{"type":"ephemeral"}` with optional `ttl: "5m"` or
`"1h"` at request, system, message, content-block, and tool locations. The
private Codex request has no Anthropic breakpoint or TTL fields, so accepted
hints do not reproduce Anthropic caching semantics. Normal `/v1/messages`
responses do not expose the Chat-only `response_id`. The custom
`/v1/messages/compact` endpoint retains its documented local
`previous_response_id` support.

### `POST /v1/messages/count_tokens`

Anthropic-compatible token counting helper. Codex OAuth does not expose a count-only endpoint equivalent to Anthropic's native API, so this route counts text locally and returns context-window metadata for the effective backend model. Normalized model-visible messages, tool calls, tool-result metadata, reasoning, and tool schemas are counted once. Request-envelope and generation-control fields are excluded, and image inputs use a separate fixed estimate so inline base64 data is not counted as text.

GPT-5-family text uses a bundled port of official `tiktoken` `o200k_base` `encode_ordinary`: the same Unicode pre-tokenization regex, byte-pair merge algorithm, and merge-rank data are implemented in Python, TypeScript, and Rust. Official `tiktoken` maps `gpt-5` and its `gpt-5-`-prefixed variants to [`o200k_base`](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken/blob/08a5f3b2c987ada4fc5aa1f16c643c203fa8acaa/tiktoken/model.py#L7-L20); this project applies that GPT-5-family encoding to the bundled `gpt-5.*` Codex model IDs. The project does not depend on a `tiktoken` package or download encoding data at runtime. The last upstream synchronization check was **2026-07-14**, against [`tiktoken` 0.13.0 at `08a5f3b`](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken/tree/08a5f3b2c987ada4fc5aa1f16c643c203fa8acaa); the bundled rank file SHA-256 is `446a9538cb6c348e3516120d7c08b09f57c36495e2acfffe59a5bf8b0cfb1a2d`.

Official Codex also has a [`ceil(UTF-8 bytes / 4)` truncation helper](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/bd2de422aa287b97b06ca6425a10935bcf1b3731/codex-rs/utils/string/src/truncate.rs#L4-L84), but Codex documents the history estimate using that helper as [a coarse lower bound rather than a tokenizer-accurate count](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/bd2de422aa287b97b06ca6425a10935bcf1b3731/codex-rs/core/src/context_manager/history.rs#L162-L186). This endpoint therefore uses exact `o200k_base` ordinary text tokenization instead. The complete request count remains an estimate because protocol-wrapper overhead and image cost are local constants, but the former byte-as-token and raw-payload double count that could overstate ordinary Claude Code requests by about 8x is removed.

```bash
curl http://localhost:18080/v1/messages/count_tokens \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: unused" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

### `POST /v1/messages/compact`

Anthropic-compatible alias for remote conversation compaction. Accepts Anthropic Messages-shaped bodies and returns compacted checkpoint content. Bundled GPT model IDs select the matching backend model, and Claude Code effort and Fast Mode controls use the same mappings as `/v1/messages`.

### `POST /v1/images/generations`

Generate images via the Codex image generation tool.

```bash
curl http://localhost:18080/v1/images/generations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-5.5",
    "prompt": "a futuristic city at sunset",
    "size": "1024x1024"
  }'
```

### `POST /v1/inspect`

Inspect images with a text prompt (custom endpoint).

```bash
curl http://localhost:18080/v1/inspect \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "Describe what you see",
    "images": [{
      "image_url": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgo...",
      "detail": "original"
    }],
    "responses_lite": false
  }'
```

### `POST /v1/compact`

Compact a conversation into a checkpoint for continuation (custom endpoint). `/v1/messages/compact` provides the Anthropic-compatible alias.

Compact accepts the existing private Codex `reasoning_effort` (or matching `reasoning.effort`) plus `prompt_cache_key`, supported `service_tier`, `text`, and top-level `verbosity`. A known process-local `previous_response_id` is resolved to its saved Response items and replayed as full compact input; the field is never forwarded to private Codex. Non-null caller-supplied `reasoning.mode` / `reasoning.context`, `prompt_cache_options`, cache breakpoints, `safety_identifier`, encrypted-reasoning `include`, and deprecated `prompt_cache_retention` are rejected instead of being silently dropped; explicit `null` is treated as omitted. When Responses Lite is active, the proxy follows the official private Codex builder and adds `reasoning.context: "all_turns"` on the compact wire.

```bash
curl http://localhost:18080/v1/compact \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize our conversation so far."},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "We discussed the project architecture."}
    ]
  }'
```

### `GET /health`

Health check. Returns auth availability, configured model and reasoning effort, Codex config path, and context-window settings.

```bash
curl http://localhost:18080/health
# {"status":"ok","auth_available":true,"model":"gpt-5.6-luna","reasoning_effort":"high","codex_config_path":"/Users/me/.codex/config.toml","context_window":272000,"auto_compact_token_limit":244800}
```

## Codex-Specific Features

These features are extensions beyond the standard OpenAI API, designed for Codex CLI compatibility.

### Prompt caching

`prompt_cache_key` keeps related prefixes in the same backend cache family. Use one stable, privacy-safe key per conversation or application prefix.

Official Codex 0.147.0 [defaults this field to its Responses metadata session ID](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/be6e8eac029b183056b7e4402879f15d2c85f61b/codex-rs/core/src/client.rs#L475-L487), and [projects the same value into `client_metadata.session_id`](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/be6e8eac029b183056b7e4402879f15d2c85f61b/codex-rs/core/src/responses_metadata.rs#L219-L228), unless an explicit override is present. This proxy follows the same precedence on Chat requests: explicit `prompt_cache_key`, then a non-empty `client_metadata.session_id`, then omission. It does not generate a process-wide session or reuse `thread_id` as the cache key.

The private Codex OAuth HTTP and WebSocket request structures do not contain public GPT-5.6 `prompt_cache_options` or content-block `prompt_cache_breakpoint` fields. This proxy treats explicit `null` as omitted and rejects non-null controls with HTTP 400 instead of forwarding a request that the private route rejects or silently pretending the requested cache policy was applied. Use a public Responses API client when explicit cache policy or breakpoints are required. See OpenAI's [public prompt caching guide](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/prompt-caching#prompt-cache-breakpoints).

```json
{
  "model": "gpt-5.6-sol",
  "prompt_cache_key": "tenant-hash:knowledge-v1",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "Answer from the supplied context."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What changed today?"}
  ]
}
```

GPT-5.6 cache accounting is returned, when the backend supplies it, as `usage.prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens` and `cache_write_tokens`. Treat those as cost/observability data, not as a conversation-truncation signal.

### `reasoning_effort` and `reasoning`

The legacy top-level `reasoning_effort` remains supported. Known values are the case-sensitive lowercase strings `none`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`, and Codex's virtual `ultra` setting. Other non-empty model-defined values are preserved. `ultra` is sent as backend effort `max`; Codex's local proactive multi-agent behavior for `ultra` is outside this proxy.

GPT-5.6 requests can instead use the public Responses-shaped object:

```json
{
  "model": "gpt-5.6-sol",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "Review carefully."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Find migration failure modes."}
  ],
  "reasoning": {
    "mode": "standard",
    "effort": "high",
    "context": "all_turns"
  }
}
```

- `mode: "standard"` is accepted as the public default and omitted from the private Codex request. If mode is explicit and neither the request nor Codex config selects an effort, the proxy sends the public GPT-5.6 default effort, `medium`.
- `mode: "pro"` returns HTTP 400. Official Codex has no private request field or alternate model/effort mapping for Pro. Codex `ultra` and `service_tier: "priority"` are different features.
- `context` is `auto`, `current_turn`, or `all_turns`. Encrypted reasoning content is included automatically on generation requests so full-history continuation can replay it.
- `reasoning_effort` and `reasoning.effort` may both be present only when equal. Conflicting values return HTTP 400.
- Responses Lite uses `all_turns` as the Codex wire default. An explicitly different context is rejected instead of silently overwritten; use `responses_lite: false` when the backend route supports classic Responses and another context is required.
- Remote compact keeps its existing private Codex `reasoning_effort` field but does not accept public `reasoning.mode` or `reasoning.context`.

Anthropic `thinking` values map as `enabled → high`, `adaptive → medium`, and `disabled → none`. Claude Code's `output_config.effort` takes precedence over adaptive or enabled thinking and supports `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max`. Call-level `thinking.disabled` takes precedence over ambient `output_config.effort`, so Claude Code WebSearch/WebFetch auxiliary calls use `none` instead of failing the compatibility check with HTTP 400. The supported reasoning context and verbosity extensions are also available on `/v1/messages`, image generation, and inspection requests; Pro and non-null public cache policy/breakpoints or `safety_identifier` fail explicitly on the private Codex provider.

The pinned official Codex HTTP request has no `stop` field. Omitted, `null`, and empty stop values are omitted from the private request; any non-empty OpenAI `stop` or Anthropic `stop_sequences` value returns HTTP 400 before the private transport starts.

The mapping is intentionally transport-aware:

| Public/facade input | Private Codex behavior |
|---|---|
| `reasoning.mode: "standard"` | Omit mode; send the resolved effort/context |
| `reasoning.mode: "pro"` | HTTP 400; no official Codex alias |
| `prompt_cache_key` | Forward an explicit value; otherwise use non-empty `client_metadata.session_id` |
| Non-null `prompt_cache_options` / breakpoint | HTTP 400; `null` is omitted and there is no private field |
| Non-null `safety_identifier` | HTTP 400; `null` is omitted and OAuth account/thread IDs are not semantic aliases |
| Non-empty `stop` / `stop_sequences` | HTTP 400; no private field |
| `previous_response_id` | Resolve locally and replay complete Response history over HTTP |
| `service_tier: "fast"` | Send `service_tier: "priority"` |
| `service_tier: "default"` | Omit the field |

Authenticated tests on July 10, 2026 verified both official continuation paths with `gpt-5.6-sol`: a direct private Responses WebSocket completed a second delta request using the exact prior `response.id`, and the private HTTP endpoint completed the same continuation when the full prior input/output history was replayed. The proxy implements the HTTP replay strategy. Direct HTTP forwarding of `previous_response_id`, Pro, public cache controls, and `safety_identifier` was rejected and is not used. See OpenAI's [reasoning mode documentation](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/reasoning#reasoning-mode) and the Codex 0.147.0 [HTTP/WebSocket request structures](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/be6e8eac029b183056b7e4402879f15d2c85f61b/codex-rs/codex-api/src/common.rs#L251-L307).

### `responses_lite`

Controls the Codex Responses Lite request shape. Accepted values are `true`, `false`, and `"auto"`. Request value takes precedence over `CODEX_AS_API_RESPONSES_LITE`; default is `"auto"`.

In `"auto"` mode, this package only uses Lite when the shared model capability table says the selected model should use it. The `gpt-5.6` alias plus Sol, Terra, and Luna use Lite automatically. Setting `responses_lite: true` forces Lite and moves tools/instructions into Lite-compatible developer input items.

Codex implements web search and image generation for Lite models through client-side standalone tools. This proxy has no standalone tool executor, so Lite requests containing hosted `web_search` or `image_generation` tools fail explicitly instead of silently dropping the tools. When a request does not override the mode, `CODEX_AS_API_RESPONSES_LITE=off` selects the existing classic request contract if the backend route supports it.

The official Codex Lite request builder removes `input_image.detail`. Accordingly, classic Responses preserve `auto`, `low`, and `high`; `original` is also preserved when the model capability advertises it. The bundled catalog enables `original` for the GPT-5.6 alias, Sol, Terra, Luna, GPT-5.5, GPT-5.4, and GPT-5.4 Mini, and rejects it for GPT-5.2 and the conservative legacy entries. Lite requests keep the image and remove only `detail` after capability validation.

### Image detail

Chat multimodal blocks are preserved instead of being flattened to text:

```json
{
  "role": "user",
  "content": [
    {"type": "text", "text": "Inspect this at native resolution."},
    {
      "type": "image_url",
      "image_url": {
        "url": "data:image/png;base64,...",
        "detail": "original"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

`/v1/inspect` accepts the equivalent flat image object: `{"image_url":"data:image/...","detail":"original"}`. Recognized detail values are `auto`, `low`, `high`, and `original`; `original` additionally requires a model capability listed above. See OpenAI's [image detail guide](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/images-vision#choose-an-image-detail-level).

### `safety_identifier` and verbosity

The public `safety_identifier` has no equivalent private Codex request field. `ChatGPT-Account-ID`, `thread-id`, and `session-id` identify different things and are not substituted. Explicit `null` is treated as omitted; a non-null `safety_identifier` returns HTTP 400.

Standard Chat `verbosity: "low" | "medium" | "high"` maps to Responses `text.verbosity`. The existing `text` extension remains supported. Supplying both is allowed only when the values agree.

### `parallel_tool_calls`

Set `parallel_tool_calls: true` to request parallel tool calls when the selected model capability allows it. The shared capability table gates this field, and Responses Lite always keeps `parallel_tool_calls` disabled.

### `client_metadata` and `codex_metadata`

`client_metadata` is forwarded to the Codex backend. Set `codex_metadata: true` or `CODEX_AS_API_CODEX_METADATA=on` to add Codex-style turn metadata. Metadata mode requires a non-empty caller-supplied `client_metadata.session_id`; it preserves that session, defaults a missing root `thread_id` to the session, and preserves an explicit child `thread_id`.

The installation ID and process window ID remain stable, while `turn_id` and `x-codex-turn-metadata` are regenerated for each request. Metadata `thread_id` is neither a `previous_response_id` alias nor a cache key. An explicit `prompt_cache_key` wins; otherwise the non-empty session ID supplies cache affinity.

### `previous_response_id`

Non-streaming responses and the final streaming finish chunk expose the real upstream Responses ID as `response_id`. The provider keeps up to 256 completed chains in a process-local LRU store. Passing a known ID as `previous_response_id` prepends the saved semantic input and exact prior `response.output_item.done` items—including encrypted reasoning and tool items—to the new input, then sends one full private HTTP request. The ID itself is never forwarded and is never converted to `thread_id`.

That event source is intentional: the Codex 0.147.0 SSE parser [takes semantic items from `response.output_item.done`](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/be6e8eac029b183056b7e4402879f15d2c85f61b/codex-rs/codex-api/src/sse/responses.rs#L330-L341), while its [`response.completed` shape contains the response ID, usage, and `end_turn`](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/be6e8eac029b183056b7e4402879f15d2c85f61b/codex-rs/codex-api/src/sse/responses.rs#L112-L160), not replay history. The authenticated private HTTP rollout likewise returned an empty `response.completed.output`; the proxy therefore commits the completed output-item events instead of treating that extra field as conversation state.

Only a real `response.completed` event commits a chain. Branches from an older retained ID are supported. Restarting the server or evicting an old entry removes that local state; an unknown ID returns HTTP 400 before any upstream request.

```bash
curl http://localhost:18080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-5.5",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Continue from where we left off."}
    ],
    "previous_response_id": "resp_abc123"
  }'
```

### Native Responses workflows not adapted by Chat

Programmatic Tool Calling and hosted Multi-agent beta introduce `program`, `program_output`, `caller`, agent-attributed items/events, beta headers, and replay rules that cannot be represented losslessly by Chat Completions tool messages. This facade therefore returns HTTP 400 for `programmatic_tool_calling`, `allowed_callers`, `output_schema`, or `multi_agent` instead of silently dropping lifecycle data. PDF `input_file.detail` is also Responses-only and is not accepted by the Chat content adapter.

Use a native Responses client/runtime for those workflows. Relevant OpenAI documentation: [Programmatic Tool Calling](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/tools-programmatic-tool-calling) and [Multi-agent beta](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/tools-multi-agent).

### `subagent` / `x-openai-subagent`

Identifies the request as coming from a specific subagent type. Values used by Codex CLI: `review`, `compact`, `memory_consolidation`, `collab_spawn`.

Can be passed as a body field or HTTP header:

```bash
# As body field
curl http://localhost:18080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-5.5",
    "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Review this code."}, {"role": "user", "content": "..."}],
    "subagent": "review"
  }'

# As HTTP header
curl http://localhost:18080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-openai-subagent: review" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-5.5",
    "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Review this code."}, {"role": "user", "content": "..."}]
  }'
```

### `memgen_request` / `x-openai-memgen-request`

Flags the request as a memory generation/consolidation request. Can be passed as a body field (`bool`) or HTTP header (`"true"/"false"`):

```bash
curl http://localhost:18080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-openai-memgen-request: true" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-5.5",
    "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Consolidate memories."}, {"role": "user", "content": "..."}]
  }'
```

## Using with OpenAI SDKs

Point the base URL to your local server:

### Python (openai SDK)

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:18080/v1",
    api_key="unused",
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-5.5",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"},
    ],
    extra_body={"prompt_cache_key": "my-session"},
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Node.js (openai SDK)

```typescript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const client = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: "http://localhost:18080/v1",
  apiKey: "unused",
});

const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-5.5",
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant." },
    { role: "user", content: "Hello!" },
  ],
});
console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
```

### curl (streaming)

```bash
curl -N http://localhost:18080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-5.5",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a joke."}
    ],
    "stream": true,
    "prompt_cache_key": "joke-session"
  }'
```

## Using with Claude Code

The `/v1/messages` endpoint implements the Anthropic Messages gateway shape used by Claude Code. The current request shape was reproduced with Claude Code `2.1.220`; streaming, real Codex OAuth chat, request-level GPT model routing, adaptive thinking, `--effort max`, and Fast Mode remain covered.

Start the proxy first. `CODEX_AS_API_MODEL` is the fallback used when Claude Code sends a built-in Anthropic model name:

```bash
CODEX_AS_API_MODEL=gpt-5.6-terra \
CODEX_AS_API_RESPONSES_LITE=off \
codex-as-api
```

`CODEX_AS_API_RESPONSES_LITE=off` is required for Claude Code hosted WebSearch on GPT-5.6. Official Codex Responses Lite uses a client-side standalone `web.run` tool, while this gateway receives Anthropic's hosted `web_search` declaration and has no standalone executor; classic Responses preserves that hosted tool. WebFetch does not use a hosted Responses tool, but still needs the disabled-thinking precedence fix when process-level effort is enabled.

To keep the built-in Fable, Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku rows and append one GPT row, launch the GPT-routed Claude Code process with these variables:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:18080 \
ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=unused \
ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION=gpt-5.6-sol \
ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION_NAME='GPT-5.6 Sol' \
ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION_DESCRIPTION='GPT-5.6 Sol through codex-as-api' \
CLAUDE_CODE_ATTRIBUTION_HEADER=0 \
claude
```

Run `/model` and select **GPT-5.6 Sol**. The custom entry is appended to the built-in rows rather than replacing them. Claude Code `2.1.220` recognizes this GPT model ID without a custom capability declaration: `/effort low|medium|high|xhigh|max`, the picker effort control, and `claude --effort ...` are translated from Claude Code's `output_config.effort` to the Codex reasoning effort. Claude Code Fast Mode's `speed: "fast"` is translated to the Codex `priority` service tier.

Claude Code sends `x-claude-code-session-id` for gateway request grouping. This
proxy hashes the exact header value into a stable `prompt_cache_key`; it does
not turn the header into Codex `session_id` or `thread_id` metadata. A
top-level `prompt_cache_key` is supported as a proxy extension and takes
precedence. Normal Messages requests remain stateless, so callers must send
full message history.

If managed settings define an `availableModels` allowlist, that list must include the exact `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION` value, such as `gpt-5.6-sol`; otherwise Claude Code hides or rejects the custom row.

For a persistent gateway configuration, put the same variables in the `env` object in `~/.claude/settings.json`. Do that only when every Claude Code process using that config should route through codex-as-api.

`ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION` adds one picker row. To make Terra or Luna the visible GPT row, change that value and the display text. Any bundled GPT model can also be selected directly without changing the visible row:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:18080 ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=unused \
  claude --model gpt-5.6-terra --effort high
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:18080 ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=unused \
  claude --model gpt-5.6-luna --effort medium
```

Known bundled GPT IDs are sent to the matching Codex backend model. Built-in Claude/Fable/Opus/Sonnet/Haiku IDs are not Codex models, so this proxy maps those requests to `CODEX_AS_API_MODEL` while preserving the selected name in the Anthropic response.

`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` applies to the whole Claude Code process. Therefore the built-in rows remain available in the picker, but they also pass through codex-as-api and use the configured Codex fallback; the rows do not call Anthropic models in that process. To use an actual Anthropic model and GPT in parallel, keep the gateway variables out of global settings, start the GPT process with the inline command above, and start a second process normally:

```bash
claude --model sonnet
```

If the gateway variables are already in `~/.claude/settings.json`, shell-level `env -u` does not override that settings file. Remove the persistent variables or use a separate `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` for the direct-Anthropic process.

Claude Code gateway discovery cannot expose raw `gpt-*` IDs because Claude Code filters discovered IDs to `claude*` and `anthropic*`. The official single custom-model option avoids a misleading facade ID. This integration is an Anthropic Messages-compatible bridge; Anthropic explicitly does not support routing Claude Code to non-Claude models through third-party gateways. See the official [model configuration](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/model-config), [gateway connection](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/llm-gateway-connect), and [gateway protocol](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/llm-gateway-protocol) references.

The current bridge accepts Claude Code's exact no-op thinking cleanup (`clear_thinking_20251015` with `keep: "all"`). Context edits that would change history, task budgets, enabled beta tool fields such as `strict` or `defer_loading`, malformed output formats, and unsupported image source types return HTTP 400 because the Codex OAuth transport has no lossless equivalent. Valid base64 and URL image blocks plus `tool_result.is_error` are preserved during translation.

## Architecture

```
Client (OpenAI SDK / curl)
    |
    v
HTTP Server (FastAPI / Axum / Express)
    |
    +---> ChatGPTOAuthProvider
            |
            +---> ~/.codex/auth.json (OAuth tokens, auto-refresh)
            +---> https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses
```

The provider handles:
- Token loading, proactive refresh five minutes before expiry, and refresh on 401
- OpenAI Responses API over SSE
- `prompt_cache_key` and cache read/write accounting
- GPT-5.6 reasoning effort/context plus `standard` mode compatibility
- Reasoning content streaming (`reasoning_content`, `reasoning`)
- Tool call streaming
- Codex-specific headers (`x-openai-subagent`, `x-openai-memgen-request`)
- Bounded process-local `previous_response_id` history replay over private HTTP
- Multimodal Chat input, image generation/inspection, and capability-gated classic `original` detail
- Remote conversation compaction

## Release & package publishing

The `Release` GitHub Actions workflow runs on a pushed `v*` tag. It rejects a
tag that does not exactly match every Python, npm, and Rust version surface,
runs the complete cross-runtime gate, and then publishes PyPI, npmjs, the
scoped GitHub npm package, platform Rust binaries, and one GitHub Release.

The workflow uses registry-supported OIDC for PyPI and npmjs. No `PYPI_TOKEN`,
`NPM_TOKEN`, personal access token, or repository secret is required. One-time
registry setup is still required:

- Create GitHub environments named `pypi` and `npm`; add deployment protection
  rules if desired.
- On PyPI, add a trusted publisher for project `codex-as-api`, owner `Eunho-J`,
  repository `codex-as-api`, workflow `release.yml`, environment `pypi`.
- On npmjs, add a GitHub Actions trusted publisher for package `codex-as-api`,
  owner `Eunho-J`, repository `codex-as-api`, workflow `release.yml`,
  environment `npm`, with `npm publish` allowed.
- GitHub Packages and GitHub Releases use the job-scoped automatic
  `GITHUB_TOKEN`; repository policy must allow the workflow's declared
  `packages: write` and `contents: write` permissions.

After bumping every version and passing the local gate, push the matching tag:

```bash
python scripts/check_package_versions.py --tag v0.6.5
git tag v0.6.5
git push origin v0.6.5
```

## Release Notes

### v0.6.5

- Align GPT-5.6 alias, Sol, Terra, and Luna context limits with Codex `0.147.0`
  at 272,000 tokens and derive the 244,800-token automatic compact threshold.
- Pin the verified upstream request, Responses Lite, header, and model contract
  to `openai/codex` commit
  `be6e8eac029b183056b7e4402879f15d2c85f61b`; track its new fractional SSE
  rollout-budget field without claiming an unapproved facade mapping.
- Refresh OAuth credentials five minutes before expiry, coalesce concurrent
  refreshes, reload changed credentials after 401, and preserve upstream HTTP
  status codes across all three servers.
- Replace startup npm version discovery with deterministic compatibility and
  package-version identity in the Codex-style `User-Agent`.
- Add full cross-runtime CI plus tag-gated OIDC publishing to PyPI and npmjs,
  `GITHUB_TOKEN` publishing to GitHub Packages, and GitHub Release assets.

### v0.6.4

- Remove process-global generated Codex session/thread identities and require
  explicit session identity when Codex metadata mode is enabled.
- Resolve Chat cache affinity as explicit `prompt_cache_key`, then
  `client_metadata.session_id`, then omission.
- Derive Claude Code cache affinity from `x-claude-code-session-id` without
  fabricating Codex metadata; keep normal Anthropic Messages stateless.
- Validate and strip Anthropic `cache_control` compatibility hints without
  claiming unavailable breakpoint or TTL semantics.
- Update current compatibility evidence to Codex `0.145.0`, Codex `main` at
  `bd2de422aa287b97b06ca6425a10935bcf1b3731`, and Claude Code `2.1.220`.

### v0.6.3

- Accept Claude Code auxiliary requests that combine ambient `output_config.effort` with call-level `thinking.disabled`.
- Give explicit disabled thinking precedence and send Codex reasoning effort `none` instead of returning HTTP 400.
- Document and test `CODEX_AS_API_RESPONSES_LITE=off` for Claude Code hosted WebSearch on GPT-5.6; WebFetch needs no Responses Lite override.
- Preserve fail-loudly validation for invalid effort values and unsupported `output_config` fields.
- Add Python, TypeScript, and Rust adapter regressions, streamed `/v1/messages` coverage, and a `/count_tokens` regression for the WebSearch/WebFetch request shape.

### v0.6.2

- Fix `/v1/messages/count_tokens` overcounting that could trigger Claude Code autocompaction on every turn.
- Count normalized model-visible messages, tool calls, reasoning, tool-result metadata, and tool schemas once; remove the second full raw-request-body addition.
- Port official `tiktoken` `o200k_base` ordinary encoding into Python, TypeScript, and Rust without adding a `tiktoken` package dependency or runtime rank download.
- Match the upstream Unicode text split and BPE merge ranks last checked on 2026-07-14 against `tiktoken` 0.13.0 at `08a5f3b`.
- Keep image input cost separate and count inline base64 images once rather than adding both a fixed image estimate and the base64 request bytes.
- Add matching Python, TypeScript, and Rust endpoint regressions: a 4,000-byte ASCII message now returns `1,012` instead of roughly `8,000`, and non-model control fields do not change the count.
- Validate the release with Claude Code `2.1.209` and real Codex OAuth chat.

### v0.6.1

- Re-audit official Codex `0.144.4` and `main` at `393f64565ab46f09d99ca4d9bd973537e72a114b`, plus Claude Code `2.1.208`, before publishing.
- Validate Claude Code `2.1.208` with real Codex OAuth chat and tool loops, and document the official custom GPT picker entry alongside Fable, Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku.
- Route bundled GPT model IDs from Anthropic requests to the selected Codex backend model while retaining configured fallback behavior for built-in Claude model names.
- Map `output_config.effort` and Fast Mode to Codex effort and priority service tier, preserve URL images and tool-error state, and handle current context/tool beta fields without silent loss.
- Keep Messages, token counting, and remote compaction aligned on effective model limits and fail-loudly validation for output formats and image sources.
- Keep Python streaming work off the ASGI event loop and make Rust Anthropic SSE truly incremental so concurrent Claude Code requests are not stalled or buffered.
- Preserve Rust streaming authentication, rate-limit, and overload errors after OAuth refresh instead of collapsing them to generic HTTP 500 failures.
- Restrict the Python source distribution to release inputs so local agent state and unrelated runtime sources cannot enter PyPI artifacts.

### v0.6.0

- Add GPT-5.6 public alias plus Sol, Terra, and Luna capability metadata, model defaults, and Codex context-window behavior.
- Refresh bundled context and default-effort metadata for current GPT-5.5, GPT-5.4, GPT-5.4 Mini, and GPT-5.2 catalog entries.
- Update Responses Lite request bodies and headers across chat, compact, and inspection paths; Lite image generation is rejected explicitly because this proxy has no standalone image-tool executor.
- Add `max`, Codex-compatible `ultra` to `max` wire conversion, future model-defined efforts, and `model_reasoning_effort` config support.
- Add GPT-5.6 reasoning effort/context, `standard` mode compatibility, capability-gated image `original` detail, standard verbosity, cache accounting, and real backend `response_id` support across Python, TypeScript, and Rust.
- Translate known `previous_response_id` values into bounded local full-history replay; reject Pro and non-null public cache policy/breakpoints or `safety_identifier` because the private Codex request contract has no equivalent field.
- Reject hosted Multi-agent and Programmatic Tool Calling on the Chat facade until their native agent/program item lifecycle can be preserved.

### v0.5.2

- Support latest Codex root-level OAuth token files while keeping PAT-only, agent-identity-only, and Bedrock-only auth files explicitly unsupported.
- Add shared model capability gating for Responses Lite, parallel tool calls, verbosity, and service-tier behavior across Python, TypeScript, and Rust.
- Preserve encrypted reasoning state via top-level `reasoning.encrypted_content` include and add Codex metadata forwarding controls.

### v0.5.1

- Add official Codex CLI `originator` and versioned `User-Agent` headers for ChatGPT/Codex OAuth requests.
- Resolve the latest `@openai/codex` version from npm at server startup, with `CODEX_AS_API_CODEX_CLI_VERSION` as an explicit override.

### v0.5.0

- Preserve Claude Code server-tool history (`server_tool_use`, `web_search_tool_result`, MCP/advisor-like result blocks) as backend context instead of dropping it on the next turn.
- Support Anthropic `output_format` structured outputs by mapping JSON schema/object formats to OpenAI Responses `text.format`.
- Preserve `document` and `search_result` content blocks inside tool results, keep Python streaming defaults aligned, and accept unsuffixed `web_search` server-tool types across Python, TypeScript, and Rust.

### v0.4.0

- Add Claude Code-compatible Anthropic hosted web search support by mapping `web_search_*` server tools to OpenAI Responses `web_search`.
- Return `server_tool_use` and `web_search_tool_result` blocks so Claude Code can parse web search results reliably.
- Prepare TypeScript package publishing to npmjs and GitHub Packages via GitHub Actions.

### v0.3.3

- Stop forwarding client `max_tokens` as Codex `max_output_tokens`, restoring Claude Code compatibility with the Codex OAuth backend.
- Add Python, TypeScript, and Rust regression tests for the provider payload.

### v0.3.2

- Restore immediate Anthropic streaming so Claude Code receives events without waiting for the backend response to finish.
- Use conservative local token estimates for `/v1/messages/count_tokens`; Codex OAuth has no count-only backend endpoint.
- Keep real final streaming usage metadata in `message_delta`.

### v0.3.1

- Attempted real backend token counting for `/v1/messages/count_tokens` with `max_output_tokens: 0`; this is superseded by v0.3.2 because Codex OAuth rejects count-only requests.
- Forward converted Anthropic tools, tool choice, stop sequences, and thinking/reasoning settings during token-count requests.
- Propagate cumulative Anthropic streaming usage, including cache accounting, server tool use, and service tier metadata when available.
- Pass `max_output_tokens` through provider requests across Python, TypeScript, and Rust.

### v0.3.0

- Read Codex CLI config from `CODEX_HOME` / `~/.codex/config.toml` across Python, TypeScript, and Rust.
- Use the configured Codex backend model while preserving Anthropic client model names in `/v1/messages` responses.
- Expose `context_window` and `auto_compact_token_limit` through `/health` and `/v1/messages/count_tokens`.
- Add Anthropic-compatible `/v1/messages/count_tokens` and `/v1/messages/compact`.
- Map context-window failures to Anthropic-style `400 invalid_request_error` responses and stream error events.
