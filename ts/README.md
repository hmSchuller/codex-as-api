# codex-as-api

Use ChatGPT / Codex OAuth as a local OpenAI-compatible API server.

## Prerequisite

Install the official Codex CLI and sign in once so `~/.codex/auth.json` exists:

```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex
codex login
```

## Install and run

```bash
npm install -g codex-as-api
codex-as-api
```

The server listens on `127.0.0.1:18080` by default.

`/v1/messages/count_tokens` bundles a dependency-free port of official
`tiktoken` `o200k_base` ordinary encoding, including the Unicode text split,
BPE merge logic, and rank data. No `tiktoken` package or runtime download is
required. The last upstream synchronization check was 2026-07-14 against
`tiktoken` 0.13.0 commit `08a5f3b2c987ada4fc5aa1f16c643c203fa8acaa`.

For configuration, supported endpoints, model behavior, and examples, see the [canonical GitHub documentation](https://github.com/Eunho-J/codex-as-api#readme).

## Identifier and cache behavior

| Input | `/v1/chat/completions` | `/v1/messages` |
|---|---|---|
| `client_metadata.session_id` | Forwarded, used as default cache affinity, and required by Codex metadata mode | Not used |
| `client_metadata.thread_id` | Codex metadata identity; root defaults to the session and an explicit child thread is preserved | Not used or synthesized |
| `prompt_cache_key` | Explicit value, then non-empty session ID, then configured fallback or omission | Explicit proxy extension, then hashed Claude Code session header |
| `previous_response_id` | Caller-supplied IDs use 256-chain process-local full-history replay; identified Cursor sessions use WebSocket continuation with full-context fallback | Non-null values return HTTP 400 |
| `cache_control` | Not a Chat control | Validated as an Anthropic hint and stripped before Codex |

Claude Code's exact `x-claude-code-session-id` value is hashed as
`SHA-256("codex-as-api:claude-code-session:" + sessionId)` for cache affinity
only. It is not converted to Codex session or thread metadata. Accepted
Anthropic cache hints use `type: "ephemeral"` with optional TTL `5m` or `1h`;
the private Codex transport cannot apply Anthropic breakpoint or TTL semantics.
For Chat requests with no explicit key or `client_metadata.session_id`, the
server uses a stable hash derived from `PROXY_API_KEY`. Set
`CODEX_AS_API_PROMPT_CACHE_KEY` to choose a separate deployment namespace.
Cursor requests with a repeated `user` value are additionally mapped to a
hashed session derived from that account value and the first user-turn history.
That mapping is per conversation, not a process-wide Cursor-user key. Matching
turns reuse a cached private Responses WebSocket and send only the new input
with `previous_response_id`; mismatches and transport failures clear the stale
continuation and use full-context SSE.
This behavior was rechecked against Codex `0.147.0` at
`be6e8eac029b183056b7e4402879f15d2c85f61b`; Claude Code compatibility was
last checked with `2.1.220`.

## Claude Code with GPT

Start `codex-as-api` with the classic Responses transport so Claude Code can use hosted WebSearch:

```bash
CODEX_AS_API_RESPONSES_LITE=off codex-as-api
```

Then launch Claude Code with one GPT entry alongside the built-in Fable, Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku rows:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:18080 \
ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=unused \
ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION=gpt-5.6-sol \
ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION_NAME='GPT-5.6 Sol' \
ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION_DESCRIPTION='GPT-5.6 Sol through codex-as-api' \
CLAUDE_CODE_ATTRIBUTION_HEADER=0 \
claude
```

Run `/model` and select **GPT-5.6 Sol**. Change `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION` to show Terra or Luna instead. Any bundled GPT ID can also be selected directly when the same base URL and token variables are present, for example `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:18080 ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=unused claude --model gpt-5.6-terra --effort high`.

Claude Code auxiliary WebSearch/WebFetch requests can combine process-level
`output_config.effort` with call-level `thinking.disabled`. The explicit
disabled setting wins and is forwarded as Codex reasoning effort `none`.
`CODEX_AS_API_RESPONSES_LITE=off` is required for hosted WebSearch because the
official Lite path uses a standalone `web.run` executor that this gateway does
not implement. WebFetch is a client-side auxiliary request, so WebFetch only
needs the disabled-thinking precedence fix and does not require the classic
transport.

If managed settings define an `availableModels` allowlist, include the exact custom option ID, such as `gpt-5.6-sol`, or Claude Code will hide or reject the GPT row.

The base URL applies to the entire Claude Code process. Built-in model rows therefore use the configured `CODEX_AS_API_MODEL` fallback through this proxy; they do not contact Anthropic while the gateway variables are active. Keep these variables out of global settings when a second, direct-Anthropic Claude Code process is required. See the [full Claude Code guide](https://github.com/Eunho-J/codex-as-api#using-with-claude-code) for routing details and current compatibility limits.
